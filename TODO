priorities:
1. persistence
2. move compound goals as one unit
3. other commands
4. astar search for scaffolding

6. opencv to scan images and convert to blueprint readable by code.
7. check that you can actually place blocks according to game rules

before resorting to a star, can try the following:
have a goal for building dirt blocks, remember the where they are so that it can remove them
only allow building below it.
lowest blocks have highest priority
limit how much it is allowed to fall
prioritize as well on a spiral pattern

could also calculate scaffolding in the area

astar actions:
place block
destroy block in way that is not in the list
build scaffold
move to cell

maybe have golem move away from the building location at the start.
scan world at position and add coordinates for finding initial state


doors are placed weirdly
ability to record build actions
it looks like minecraft is saving data using writeAdditional
task profile
consider having the class inherit from golementity instead.
should explode if only can see player

GENERAL:
notifications when overwriting, etc

texture to distinguish between normal golems
persistence (saving tasks, who the golem belongs to, etc)
owner identification
inventory
build houses/mining/cutting wood/ fishing etc.
gui alternative that call commands

OTHER:
items to set focus and to set custom profiles
arrow/flare for calling over golems in area
golem equipment
carry player

vindicator has target selector for player
